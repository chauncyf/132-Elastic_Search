1. Run the elasticsearch server in the background (e.g., double click on
<elasticsearch home directory> bin\elasticsearch.bat in Windows)

2. run: python index.py (builds an index called simple_film_index)

3. run: python query.py

4. open http://127.0.0.1:5000 in browser in order to query the application
